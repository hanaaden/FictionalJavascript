**Arrays & Objects Mastery Practice Roadmap**

---

## Project 1 – Student Grades Manager

**Goal:** Practice `.map()`, `.forEach()`, `.find()`, `for...in`

**Steps:**

1. Create an array of at least 5 students with properties: `id`, `name`, `grade`.
2. Use `.forEach()` to log each student’s name.
3. Use `.map()` to create a new array with only student names.
4. Use `.find()` to get the student with the highest grade.
5. Loop through a student object using `for...in` to log keys & values.
6. Optional: Display results in HTML.

**Skills Practiced:** `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.find()`, object iteration, array of objects.

## Project 2 – Task Tracker Pro

**Goal:** Practice `.some()`, `.every()`, `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`

**Steps:**

1. Create an array of 5 tasks with properties: `id`, `title`, `completed`.
2. Use `.some()` to check if any tasks are incomplete.
3. Use `.every()` to check if all tasks are completed.
4. Use `Object.keys()` to get keys of the first task.
5. Use `Object.values()` to get values of the first task.
6. Optional: Display tasks and results in HTML.

**Skills Practiced:** Array condition checking, object keys/values, boolean logic.

## Project 3 – Shopping Cart

**Goal:** Practice `.reduce()`, immutability, array/object manipulation

**Steps:**

1. Create an array of 4 products: `{ id, name, price }`.
2. Use `.reduce()` to calculate total cart price.
3. Add a new product without mutating the original array.
4. Remove a product without mutating the original array.
5. Update a product price immutably.
6. Optional: Display products and total in HTML.

**Skills Practiced:** Reduce, immutability, array transformations.

## Project 4 – Word Counter

**Goal:** Practice `.reduce()`, object counting, string → array → object

**Steps:**

1. Take a string: "js is fun and js is powerful and fun".
2. Split into words.
3. Use `.reduce()` to build an object with word counts.

   * Example output: `{ js: 2, is: 2, fun: 2, and: 2, powerful: 1 }`
4. Optional: Display word counts in HTML `<ul>`.

**Skills Practiced:** Reduce, object value updates, string/array conversion.

---

## Project 5 – Mega Task Manager App

**Goal:** Combine everything learned

**Steps:**

1. Tasks array: `{ id, title, completed }`.
2. Add tasks with unique IDs (`Date.now()` or increment).
3. Mark tasks as completed (update object immutably if possible).
4. Delete tasks.
5. Use `.map()` to display tasks.
6. Use `.find()` to retrieve a task by id.
7. Use `.some()` / `.every()` to check completion.
8. Use `.reduce()` to count completed tasks.
9. Use `Object.entries()` to display task details.
10. Optional: Full HTML interface (inputs, buttons, list, stats).

**Skills Practiced:** Full mastery of arrays + objects, DOM interaction, state management.

**Instructions:**

* Complete projects step by step.
* Start with Project 1, practice console first, then HTML display.
* Move sequentially to Project 5.
* Tick off each method as you practice.
* By the end, you will have advanced mastery of arrays and objects in JavaScript.
