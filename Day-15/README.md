# More about Objects

**CRUD** = Create, Read, Update, Delete.

This concept is used everywhere:

In databases (insert, select, update, delete records).

In APIs (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE requests).

In JavaScript objects (add, read, update, delete properties).

## Nested Objects & Arrays
 What does it mean?

An object can contain another object inside it.

An object can also contain an array.

That array can itself contain objects.

This is useful because real-world data is rarely flat. Example:

A classroom has one teacher (object).

A classroom has many students (array of objects).

## objects methods (functions inside objects)
objects can have functions as properties 


The destructuring syntax is a JavaScript syntax that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. It can be used in locations that receive data (such as the left-hand side of an assignment or anywhere that creates new identifier bindings).


Object.keys(obj): Returns an array of the object's keys.
bject.values(obj): Returns an array of the object's values.
Object.entries(obj): Returns an array of key-value pairs.
