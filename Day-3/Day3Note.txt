DOM vs VDOM

Imagine your computer screen is 
a big drawing (the Real DOM). 
Every time you change something, 
even a tiny bit, the computer has 
to redraw a lot, which can be slow.
Now, think of a super-fast scratchpad
 (the Virtual DOM). 
When you want to change the drawing, 
you first make all your little changes
 on this scratchpad. Then, the computer
 quickly compares the scratchpad to 
the big drawing and only updates the
 exact tiny parts that are different.

This makes changes on your screen 
much faster and smoother!

An algorithm is a step-by-step set 
of instructions or rules designed 
to solve a specific problem or 
accomplish a task. It's a precise 
sequence of operations that, when
 followed, guarantees a predictable
 outcome.
