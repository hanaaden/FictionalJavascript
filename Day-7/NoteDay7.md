# Async JS
### Async/await

There’s a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion, called “async/await”. It’s surprisingly easy to understand and use.

The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.

"async and await make promises easier to write"

async makes a function return a Promise

await makes a function wait for a Promise
