 # LOOPS

 These are the different loops we will be discussing in this chapter:
  - while loop
  - do while loop
  - for loop
  - for in
  - for of loop

  ### while loop
   A while loop executes a
 certain block of code as long as an expression evaluates to true.

 ### do while loop
 It executes what is within the 
do block, and then after that it evaluates the
while . If the condition is  true , it will execute what is in the do block again. It will continue to do so until the condition in the false

### for loops
 for loops are special loops. The syntax might be a little bit confusing at
 first, but you will find yourself using them soon, because they are very
 useful.

 ### Nested loops
 Sometimes it can be necessary to use a loop inside a loop. A loop inside a
 loop is called a nested loop. Often it is not the best solution to the problem.
 It could even be a sign of poorly written code (sometimes called "code
 smell" among programmers), but every now and then it is a perfectly fine
 solution to a problem.

 ### break and continue
  break and continue are two keywords that we can use to control the flow
 of execution of the loop. break will stop the loop and move on to the code
 below the loop. continue will stop the current iteration and move back to
 the top of the loop, checking the condition (or in the case of a for loop,
 performing the statement and then checking the condition).

  - break
 We have already seen break in the 
executed, the 
switch statement. When 
break was
 switch statement ended. This is not very different when it
 comes to loops: when the 
break statement is executed, the loop will end,
 even when the condition is still true.

 ###  continue
 break can be used to quit the loop, and continue can be used to move on
 to the next iteration of the loop. It quits the current iteration and moves back
 up to check the condition and start a new iteration
