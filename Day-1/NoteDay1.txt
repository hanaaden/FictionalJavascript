javascript is dynamic typed while typescript is static typed 
means typecript allows explicit type if declaration for variable etc while javascript is variables 
determined at runtime and there is flexibility 
JS is interpreted while TS is compiled 
TS offers error detection

ternary operator is shortcut way for writing simple if-else statements it is 
also called a conditional operatorbecouse it works based on condition 
ternary operator allows you to quick decide between two values depending on the condition 
syntax:
condition ? trueExpression: falseExpression 

the best way to declare varaible is to use Let and const since var is old version 

let is block scope
Hoisting: Hoisted but not initialized, so accessing it before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
paractices: for variables that need to be reassigned.

========================================

var is function scope
Hoisting: var are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized as undefined.
paractice  Generally avoided in modern JavaScript

========================================

 const is block scoped
Hoisting: Hoisted but not initialized, so accessing it before declaration results in a ReferenceErro
for variables that should not be reassigned.

========================================

scope refers how varaibles,objects and functions are accesible 
= function scope is varaible declered within the function\
they are only accesible within function


function myfun(){
    var local = 100
    console.log("the local variable is " + local)
}

if we console console.log(local) now here it will give error
myfun()

 = block scope Variables declared with let or const
 inside a block like within {}  are only accessible within that block.
{
    let block = "I am block"
    console.log(block)
}
 if we console console.log(block) now here it will give error
